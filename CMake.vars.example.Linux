# LINUX
# On linux, there should be no need to set up *_ROOT directories, in the default settings, they all point to /usr/local, as should be true on Debian systems.
# We mainly support gcc and CLang compilers with C++11 support.

# BASIC CONFIGURATION

  # Global
  # Generate static libs (instead of dynamic - when this option is disabled, dynamic library is built and therefore you may encounter problems with static library dependencies)
  set(HERMES_STATIC_LIBS YES)
  
  # Target path

      # Sequential version of MUMPS may be enabled by setting YES on the following line
      # and pointing to the package installation directory with MUMPS_ROOT. To enable the
      # parallel version, setting WITH_MPI to YES in addition to that should suffice. If link
      # problems arise, it may be that the automatically found SCALAPACK libraries (reported
      # during the CMake configuration phase) do not match those used when compiling MUMPS.
      # In this case, set SCALAPACK_LIBRARIES manually and reconfigure Hermes.

    # If MPI is enabled, the MPI library installed on the system should be found by
    # CMake automatically. If the found library doesn't match the one used to compile the
    # particular MPI-dependent package, the other two options should be used to specify it:
