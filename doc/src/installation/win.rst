    You can download both the dependency libraries and header files, as well as Hermes libraries and header files from `<https://github.com/l-korous/hermes-windows>`_.

The rest of the instructions here are for building Hermes from source.

To obtain the source code, clone the Git repository from Github::
  
    git clone https://github.com/hpfem/hermes.git
    
[IMPORTANT] As Hermes uses features of C++11 (such as initializer lists, nullptr_t, etc.), the only Visual Studio family compiler you can use is Visual Studio 2013 (both Express and 'Full' versions).

Dependency check-list - overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - You need to install dependent libraries into either common directory, or separate directories. This directory, further called 'dependencies' (stands for the particular directory in the case of particular dependency), has to have three subdirectories as follows. The choice of having a single common directory, or separate ones is up to you.

    - 'dependencies'\\include: Header files (\*.h) of dependency libraries.
    - 'dependencies'\\lib: Library files (\*.lib) of dependency libraries.   
    - 'dependencies'\\bin: Binary modules (\*.dll) of dependency libraries.
    - be sure to include a directory 'dependecies'\\bin into the 'PATH' environment variable (you need to include all of them if you chose to have separate ones for various dependencies).
  - For the 64-bit version, if you want to use it side-by-side to the 32-bit one, you can create a subdirectory 'x64' in the 'lib' folder where you will be putting the 64-bit dependency libraries.
  
Dependency check-list - 32-bit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This list works for 32-bit version of Hermes. See the section for 64-bit version if that is the one you are interested in.
Please note that e.g. TCMalloc, BSON, UMFPACK are also 'optional', but to get the most performance out of Hermes, they are recommended.

Building Hermes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 In order to build the library and examples, you need to:

 - Prepare dependecy libraries, see 'Dependency Check-list'.
 - Copy the file 'CMake.vars.example.Windows' to 'CMake.vars'. The file contains settings for the project.
 - In the root Hermes directory, generate project files by running CMAKE from a command prompt::

       cmake . -G "Visual Studio 12"      # MSVC2013 as the generator

   If you have Cygwin installed, your might have an error "Could not create named generator Visual Studio 12". This is because your 
   cmake path is contaminated by Cygwin's cmake. Try to use absolute path for windows cmake.exe. 
   
 - Open the SLN file 'hermes.sln' and build Hermes.

Using Hermes
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
In order to use Hermes in your project, you need to do the following steps. Steps has 5, 6, and 7 to be repeated for every configuration, i.e., Debug, Release. Except the step 7b, this can be done easily by setting the drop-down Configuration to 'All configurations' in the Project Property dialog.

  - Prepare Hermes to be buildable by MSVC, see 'Building Hermes'.
  - Create your project in MSVC. Set the project to be an empty Win32 console project.
  - Add directories 'dependencies\\lib' to additional library directories (<right click on your project>\\Properties\\Configuration Properties\\Linker\\Additional Library Directories).
  - Add also the directory where you copied Hermes libraries to as an additional library directory. This would probably be the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX in your CMake.vars file.
  - Add 'include "hermes2d.h"', make sure that your CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is among Include Directories settings in your compiler.
  - Add the dependencies\\include directory (and possibly other directories where you copied dependency headers) using
  
    - Project -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> VC++ Directories -> Include Directories

  - Deny (Ignore) warnings that are not indicating anything dangerous:

    - Ignore warnings about STL in DLL by denying a warning 4251 (<right click on your project>\\Properties\\Configuration Properties\\C/C++\\Advanced\\Disable Specific Warnings, enter 4251).
    - Ignore warnings about standard functions that are not safe (<right click on your project>\\Properties\\Configuration Properties\\C/C++\\Preprocessor\\Preprocessor Definitions, add _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS).
    - Also ignore any template instantiation warnings
  - Resolve unresolved linker error in Xerces
